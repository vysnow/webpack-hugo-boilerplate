# Vue2 Webpack with Hugo Boilerplate

## What is it?
This is a template that combines vue2/sass/Tailwind/postcss and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/#)

It was extracted from the legacy front-end project. 

## Setup
1. install Hugo
Learn from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/#)

2. If you are not in Apple Chip, you can use node-sass
```npm
npm uninstall sass
npm install --save-dev node-sass
```

3. Run command to start the build
```npm
npm run start
```


## Some Tips
This is just a template for specific using, but it is qualified to transform for any requirements. 

It is only a self story, anyone can change it to apply its requirements.

## Todo
Vue2 is a legacy, Hugo is cool. Make a boilerplate with Vue3/Vite and Hugo.(in another repo)
